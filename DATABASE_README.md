## Database Structure

### Core Hierarchy
```
takeoff.plans (Winchester, Oxford, etc.)
  â””â”€â”€ takeoff.plan_elevations (A, B, C + Foundation type)
      â””â”€â”€ takeoff.plan_options (Base Home, Design Option, Structural)

## Useful Queries

### 1. Compare Costs Between Options
```sql
-- Compare total costs between Base Home, Design Option, and Structural for same plan/elevation
SELECT 
    p.plan_name,
    pe.elevation_name,
    pe.foundation,

GROUP BY p.plan_name, pe.elevation_name, pe.foundation, po.option_type
ORDER BY p.plan_name, pe.elevation_name, po.option_type;
```

### 2. Cost Breakdown by Cost Group
```sql
-- Get cost breakdown by cost group for a specific plan/elevation/option
SELECT 
    cg.cost_group_name,
    SUM(t.extended_price) as group_total,
    COUNT(t.takeoff_id) as line_items,
    AVG(t.extended_price) as avg_line_item
FROM takeoff.takeoffs t

WHERE p.plan_name = 'Winchester' 
  AND pe.elevation_name = 'A' 
  AND pe.foundation = 'Basement'
GROUP BY cg.cost_group_name
ORDER BY group_total DESC;
```

### 3. Find Most Expensive Items Across All Plans
```sql
-- Top 20 most expensive line items across all takeoffs
SELECT 
    p.plan_name,
    pe.elevation_name || ' - ' || pe.foundation as elevation,
    po.option_type,

JOIN takeoff.plans p ON pe.plan_id = p.plan_id
ORDER BY t.extended_price DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 4. Plan Comparison Summary

    COUNT(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Base%' THEN 1 END) as has_base_home,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Design%' THEN 1 END) as has_design_option,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Structural%' THEN 1 END) as has_structural,
    SUM(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Base%' THEN t.extended_price ELSE 0 END) as base_home_cost,
    SUM(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Design%' THEN t.extended_price ELSE 0 END) as design_option_cost,
    SUM(CASE WHEN po.option_type LIKE '%Structural%' THEN t.extended_price ELSE 0 END) as structural_cost
FROM takeoff.takeoffs t
JOIN takeoff.jobs j ON t.job_id = j.job_id
JOIN takeoff.plan_options po ON j.plan_option_id = po.plan_option_id
JOIN takeoff.plan_elevations pe ON po.plan_elevation_id = pe.plan_elevation_id

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection timeout**: Check internet connection to Hostinger servers
2. **Authentication failed**: Verify username and password in config
3. **Schema not found**: Ensure you're connecting to 'takeoff_pricing_db' database
4. **Excel file format**: Ensure files are .xlsx format with correct column headers
5. **Python dependencies**: Install all required packages with pip

### Diagnostic Tools

```bash
# Check system status
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000 after starting web interface

# View system logs
# (Archived; contact admin if historical logs are needed)
```

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Views**: Predefined views are optimized for common queries
2. **Filter Early**: Use WHERE clauses to limit data before JOINs
3. **Index Usage**: The system includes indexes on commonly queried fields
4. **Connection Pooling**: Web interface uses connection pooling for efficiency
